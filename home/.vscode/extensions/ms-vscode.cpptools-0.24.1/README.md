## Installation
The extension has OS-specific binary dependencies, so installation via the Marketplace requires an Internet connection so that these additional dependencies can be downloaded. If you are working on a computer that does not have access to the Internet or is behind a strict firewall, you may need to use our OS-specific packages and install them by invoking VS Code's `"Install from VSIX..."` command. These "offline' packages are available at: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/releases.
* `cpptools-linux.vsix` - for 64-bit Linux
* `cpptools-linux32.vsix` - for 32-bit Linux
* `cpptools-osx.vsix` - for macOS
